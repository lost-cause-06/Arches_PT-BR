"The terrible change comes almost exactly three weeks later."
"Cameron had been feeling strange ever since they got back home, like he wasn't quite himself."
"After a flurry of hospital visits, police interviews, and even harassment from the media, things had become strangely quiet."
"{i}He's a broken road.{/i}"
"Brian Dubois was a serial killer with a victim count in the double-digits, with all of the murders taking place over the course of nearly four decades."
"That would get national attention, of course, especially since Brian appeared to be involved in the high-profile disappearance of a college freshman last year."
"The body-cam footage of their dramatic rescue from the mines even made the rounds on social media."
"... For about two days."
"At the same time, a pandemic was picking up steam, and all media attention focused on that instead."
"Cameron didn't mind: That lack of attention made his recovery much easier."
"His burst liver and severely damaged kidney had left him needing surgery."
"The hospital did what they could for his elbow, and his doctors were hopeful that with a lot of physical therapy, he could at least use it for basic necessities."
"While it did suck to maybe never be able to bend his elbow correctly, or without pain, what really devastated Cameron was the weakness and constant tingling in his pinky and ring finger left him feeling like he might lose his mind."
"So for now, despite him being eager to get back to it, guitar was an absolute no."
"For now."
"\"{i}But what about forever?{/i}\""
"On top of that, Cameron had been trying to banish that damn voice from his head."
"No, the negative {i}thoughts{/i} from his head... right?"
"Just a flashback, one of the shitty leftovers from his shroom trip."
"Either way, all he could do was try to ignore it, despite it making itself known at least once a day."
"\"{i}Cameron... Cameron... Cameron... Something's wrong...{/i}."
"But things continued to feel strange."
"It didn't seem to be related to his ESP, because he could easily tell when that was happening."
"Ever since the shroom trip, a haze of psychic ability lingered around him, allowing him to capture thoughts and feelings seemingly at random."
"\"Downloading\" is what some people like him liked to call it."
"He didn't have much control, though."
"Sometimes he wasn't even able to tell if the download he was receiving was from the living or the dead."
"Cameron even began to try and hone his abilities, and experiment with just how much he could do."
"What he quickly figured out was that without some sort of illicit substance, his clairvoyance lacked a great deal of fuel that had powered his abilities in Echo."
"That would make it easier, and so would being in an \"active\" location like Echo."

"Every now and then, Cameron would find himself pausing as a chill would run down his spine, like he did near the backdoor of Devon's parent's house"
"That feeling always meant an \"Echo\" was attached to something, somewhere nearby."
"That's what Cameron called the beings... not exactly intelligent, or even living, but entities that interacted with and usually threatened the living."
"In that particular case, it emanated from under the back porch."
"When he told Devon about it, the bear knew immediately what Cameron was talking about."

"Where does it come from?"
"What the hell even is it?"
"All he knows is that it's not a person, and it never was a person."
"Because they're all demons."
"And while Cameron had seen that old spark of interest in Devon's eyes, he had told Cameron to just ignore it and focus on their visit, for now."
"And also to please not mention it to his parents while they were there."
"Devon just wanted everything to go away, quietly, like it never happened."
"That included Cameron's abilities."
"That was at the end of the second week, and over the course of his life, Cameron would look back on that visit as one of the last times he was truly himself."

"Arturo's improvement was also rapid, but Cameron was left feeling a little sad that Artie never asked to talk to him, and would only ask Devon how the coyote was holding up."
"It made sense, he would tell himself."
"Devon and Artie go back further than even Devon and himself did."
"Sure, something had felt off, but considering the circumstances, nothing was normal at that time."

"Sometimes he'd still wake up whimpering, or crying, thinking he was back in Echo."
"Devon had it far worse, waking up in a howling panic, yelling about guns, chains, and death."
"Those were the times when Cameron did his best to give comfort and support, at least as best as his patched up and sore body could manage."
"But now, as time grows between him and what happened, Cameron feels like a part of him is missing, like he's not fully present."
"It's like pieces of him litter the town of his trauma."
"It felt like he was still there, in a way, and when that feeling really started to set in, that's when it happened."

"Short asides that were sometimes mean, sometimes meaningless, and sometimes boring, all about the things Cameron would do, and the people he would see."
"It feels like it's trying to remind Cameron things aren't okay as weeks continued to come and go with manageable, but clearly-present psychotic symptoms."
"He had worried his broken arm would stop him from being able to play music as well as he used to."
"Turns out, he didn't have to worry about that at all, because he doesn't give a fuck anymore."
"Like a switch, his interests, his motivation, his want to do anything productive, or useful seemed to just... turn off."

"The symptoms of schizophrenia are devastating enough, but so are the side-effects of the antipsychotics to treat it."
"Side-effects that are covered up by medications that cause even more side-effects, which in turn are maybe more tolerable."
"The first antipsychotic he tried made him too tired, and his flat affect unnerved Devon, even though he never said it."
"So, he was finally switched after four months."
"This switch had dysregulated his dopamine, according to his last psychiatrist, and this in turn meant that the motor and vocal tics he once thought were gone are now back."
"But they weren't just back, they got to come back with a vengeance, to the point that when he got especially emotional, his neck and sometimes his body would go into an uncontrollable twitching fit."
"At least back when he was a kid, he could control it to some degree, or at the very least disguise it."
"His vocal tics would come up at the worst moments, and talking to anyone other than Devon would result in awful humiliations that sometimes even triggered psychosis again."
"It makes him feel like some kind of freak show."
"But when a vocal tic involving his diaphragm appeared, one that he'd never had before, Cameron really began to despair."
"It would force him to exhale for ten to fifteen seconds before holding it until he nearly blacked out."
"Then it would release, and he would gasp in air again, vision coming back through blurry tears, only for it to happen half-a-dozen more times in agonizing waves."
"It was so distressing that each time it happened, it triggered an episode, and he'd be left with so many tics happening at once that even Devon couldn't communicate with him."
"The familiar tightening in his abdomen signaling the approach of another tic was enough to make him whine and cry in dread."
"All of this because of that damn pill that was supposed to help him."
"Three or four of those vocal episodes every day for a week, and Devon finally had enough and found a different psychiatrist."
"This changed everything, and Cameron found himself trusting her far more than he ever did his first psychiatrist."
"She immediately switched him to another antipsychotic, one that she said would help his tics, too."
"Still, when Cameron had been readying himself to take his first dose, he broke down, and he had cried like a child."
"He even begged Devon not to make him take it, which just made the whole situation so much worse."
"What if it caused more problems to show up?"
"What if it made him worse?"
"Cameron read about all the horrible, lifelong side-effects that antipsychotics can cause."
"Movement disorders like Tourette syndrome that can stick around even if you stop the meds."

"But only a little, because while he knows he's taken plenty of steps forward, it seems like he always ends up back where he started as soon as something goes wrong."
"He begins opening his pill organizer and pulls out the most important one."
"At least his psychiatrist had been right and, for once, Cameron can at least see a road to... the new him."

"While sex is the last thing on his mind, Cameron knows it's important in their relationship."
"He occasionally would force himself to do it, and pretend to enjoy it, but everything aches now, and in the end, he'd find himself staring at the ceiling."

"She leans in to give Arturo a kiss, and Arturo takes it without a single hint of embarrassment or annoyance."
"Another solid rock in Artie's life, and one that will stay until the end."
"While Cameron would normally never invade someone's mind like this, the coyote doubts he'll have many chances to do so again in the future, and he needs to know if Artie's on a good track, or not."

"Maria turns to Cameron, and because they themselves have been friends for years, even a little longer than he's known Devon, he can tell that this is weirdly set up."
Maria "\"Oh yeah: antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood-stabilizers. It feels like I've been through almost all of them.\""
c "\"Yeah? They all make me want to sleep all day, but also tear out my fur and crawl out of my skin.\""
Maria "\"I remember feeling that way all the time! I guess you kind of get used to it, or it got better, but it depends on the person, of course...\""

"Cameron likes Maria a lot, and just like Devon and Arturo, they slip back into the old swing of things."
"It's nice, but he can't help but notice how he's been swept out of the conversation with Arturo."
a "\"Anyway, the main reason I went back to work this early is because I needed something t-to feel normal again.\""
a "\"Sure, things are harder now, s-stuttering, memory is shit, can't really... depend on the right side of my b-body anymore.\""
a "\"But fuck, is it nice not being cooped up in here wishing things were different.\""
a "\"The only thing work has complained about is that I guess my inhibitions are a bit lower th-than they used to be, which must mean they're n-non-existent now, right?\""
d "\"I swear I'm not trying to be a dick, but I haven't even noticed that.\""
a "\"Oh yeah, they said something about 'too many words, too little tact', like, three years ag-ago, so I'm pretty sure it's just me but magnified.\""
"Cameron turns his full attention back to his own conversation, the effort of trying to figure out what's going on while keeping up with what's being said is far too difficult."
Maria "\"I can kind of tell that it might be affecting you now, but sometimes it's hard to tell the side-effects from symptoms of psychosis, especially the residual negative symptoms.\""
Maria "\"I mean, positive symptoms are obvious, but making your thoughts flow normally again? Making yourself want to go back outside, talk to people, live?\""
Maria "\"That tends to come back last, and sometimes it might come back a bit different.\""
"Maria has been suffering from her disorder for years longer than Cameron, and he senses her reluctance to say what might happen."
"{i}Sometimes it doesn't come back, and you'll always wish to just be who you used to be, but you learn to live with it.{/i}"
"Now, while he tries to hold a conversation about psychotropic medications with Maria, he realizes how much things have changed."
"In fact, if Cameron's visions hold true, this will be one of the last of a handful of times he'll speak to Artie."
"It hurts."
"It leaves Cameron feeling a deep pit of guilt, shame, and even a little anger, but mostly because it's unfair, and he can't blame anyone."
"But... as he watches his old friend laugh and talk to Dev, almost like what happened never happened..."
"Cameron sees a long, solid friendship ahead of them, and he's happy for that."
"Cameron realizes, even without having to read minds, that Maria is specifically there to keep Cameron distracted, to keep him away from Arturo."
"That finally shuts up the psychic part of Cameron's brain."
"Rather than leaving a hollow feeling, he's left feeling like he's been punched."
"Why are they treating him like a monster?"
"Like he's the one..."
"The final thought he receives is from Maria, and deep down, under her concern for Cameron's diagnosis, she's wondering if he's prodding at Arturo's mind."
"Arturo can sense him."
"His own sensitivity is subtle, almost too understated to be picked up on, but it's there, and that's why he feels like Cameron is carrying Echo with him."
"Cameron is mainly worried that Arturo knows what he's doing right now, and his neck and cheeks become warm, feeling like he's been caught in the act for the first time."
"Then Maria mentions something about how she has tardive dyskinesia, and Cameron focuses back on their conversation, genuinely curious if it's gotten better for her with time."
"And that's how the rest of the afternoon plays out."
"The reason he'll only see Arturo two or three more times in his life isn't because of Arturo or Maria."
"It's because Cameron knows he can't come back here and cause them stress like this."
"Cameron is no longer part of their lives, and he simply can't be, no matter how hard any of them try."
"Despite the hurt from learning their thoughts about him, Arturo's future is, if he has to sum it up, a happy one."
"And who can ask for any more than that?"
"But he had worked hard to get on the right track, and even though Cameron knows luck is just as important in these life-altering experiences, seeing Artie content gives him hope."

"Time continues on in its steady, unrelenting march, and it brings with it both good and bad."
"The pandemic falls into the background."
"Global instability and war comes to the forefront."
"Money becomes tighter."
"And the world keeps moving on, as it always will."
"It still leaves Devon almost breathless at the idea that he'd {i}changed{/i} their lives in one weekend."
"While he has never really personally hated anyone to the point that he just wanted to hurt them, he does now."
"But that person is dead."
"He got the easy way out."
"For the first year, Devon wasn't sure how he'd continue his life."
"Cameron was either always sedated to the point of almost becoming unresponsive, or angry and sad to the point that he'd just sit in the bathroom and cry."
"The feeling of helplessness, of knowing that Cameron wanted to be dead, that he'd given up so much that he even told the bear he'd take opioids again if he could."
"And so Dev started doing things he didn't want to do: Checking Cameron's drawers, pockets, and his side of the closet when he wasn't around."
"He's angry at the medical professionals who sent Cameron home because he simply had \"intrusive thoughts\"."
"This had relieved Cameron, though Devon was unsure."
"In fact he knew it wasn't right, but Cameron was so happy, and it seemed to stop the episode."
"But then, over the next two days, he was in a deep psychotic state."
"His intrusive thoughts were actually thought insertions and by the time they got back to the hospital, he was screaming that he was actually dead."
"He accused Devon of planting speakers in the walls, and video cameras in the mirror, which he shattered."
"Over that first month, it was a normal sight to see Cameron sitting up in bed, brushing away non-existent bugs, completely unresponsive to anything Devon would say."
"But, that's two years behind them now, and Cameron is finally starting to really live and become someone who seems to enjoy life again."
"Because while the positive symptoms of delusions and hallucinations had been practically absent over the past year, the negative symptoms lingered."
"Devon had read about that over and over again."
"Lack of motivation, lack of interest in things that once gave pleasure, lack of expressive emotions, and moments of confusion, and disorganized thought."
"It was the anhedonia that scared Cameron the most."
"It scared Devon too, because what's a life worth living if you don't want to do the things you trained and aspired to do most of your life?"
"Despite being able to listen to music again, Cameron decided a few months back to finally hang up his guitar."
"Cameron's paw is still weak, and it still has a slight tremor to it when he holds it up."
"But Cameron hadn't touched his keyboard either, leaving it unplugged and dusty in their basement."
"The sight made Devon far more sad than it did Cameron."
"He still wonders if he'd been more of an advocate for Cameron, maybe pushed for further observation, they could have stopped the psychosis before it truly spiraled."
"Maybe he'd be his old self."

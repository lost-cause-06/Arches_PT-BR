"He's never been this high before."
"His sixteen-year-old self would be able to handle this no problem, but the shroom trip he went through sometime during junior year had ruined most reality-distorting drugs for him."
"Even when he smoked the cheap, weak bud his friends provided through high school, he would still come close to freaking out."
"But he always had an oxy back in those days to calm himself down, or at least whatever benzo he managed to steal from his mom's medicine cabinet."

"Because when Artie offered the pen, he remembered that seeing things always became easier when he was high."
"It wasn't really a positive part of being high, but if he's going to be doing this psychic shit, maybe he should experiment more with it?"
"He feels very differently about it now."
"Weed seemed like a good, harmless, way to test his experiment ten minutes ago."
"But now Cameron is questioning if weed even triggered supernatural stuff for him in the first place."
"He was always on other stuff whenever he smoked weed, after all."
"Opioids, stimulants, dissociatives, and definitely hallucinogens like shrooms did the trick, but for obvious reasons, he's never going to try those things again."

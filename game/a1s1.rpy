#"Just three days ago, one of these men spiked his drink."
"Foram três dias  atrás, que um desses homem batizou a bebida dele."
#"Just two days ago, he woke up in restraints."
"Foram dois dias atrás, quando ele acordou com amarras."
#"Just yesterday, he was being tortured."
"Foi ontem, que ele estava sendo torturado."
#"Just ten minutes ago, he escaped."
"Foi dez minutos atrás, quando ele escapou."
#"But now, he's realizing that it doesn't matter."
"Mas agora, ele percebe que não importa."
#"Everywhere he looks is only burning desert. There's no one."
"Ele olha ao redor e não vê nada além do deserto escaldante. Não tem ninguém."
#"His attempts to scream for help matter even less because his voice is broken. He can barely wheeze after what the man did to him."
"Importam menos suas tentativas de gritar por socorro. Sua voz está rouca. Ele mau consegue respirar depois do que o homem fez com ele."
#"And now his empty, droning sounds are being swallowed up by the desert."
"E agora seus sons roucos e vazios são engolidos pelo vazio do deserto."
#"All the while, the heavy steps scraping through gravel behind him keep coming. The man isn't in a hurry at all."
"Tudo isso enquanto passos pesados se arrastam lentamente pelo cascalho atrás dele. O homem não tem pressa."
#"Running was something he was always good at."
"Correr era algo que ele sempre foi bom em fazer."
#"But now, when it matters most, he can't do it."
"Mas agora, quando mais importa, ele não consegue."
#"The fastest freshman at a D1 university is no faster than an old druggie."
"O calouro mais rápido numa universidade de respeito não é mais rápido que um velho drogado."
#"He definitely would have been if he'd eaten anything over the past three days."
"Ele com certeza seria se ele tivesse comido nos últimos três dias."
#"If his ribs weren't broken. If he could see straight."
"Se suas costelas não estivessem quebradas, se ele conseguisse ver direito."
#"The man had given him something. He'd told him it was for the pain, but the pain is still there, and now he can't even stand."
"O homem tinha dado um remédio pra ele. Disse que era pra dor, mas a dor não passou, e agora ele mal consegue ficar de pé."
#"His balance is shot, and he keeps stumbling until he's just crawling on all fours."
"Seu equilíbrio é abalado, e ele cambaleia até andar de quatro."
#"It's now that he realizes the man had let him get away on purpose."
"E é agora que ele percebe: O homem deixou ele escapar de propósito."
#"This makes him realize something else: He's going to die."
"E ele percebe mais uma coisa: Ele vai morrer."
#"Tired from the drug, from the past three days of constant fear and torture, and from trying to run, he collapses."
"Cansado do remédio estranho, dos últimos três dias de medo e tortura constante, e de tentar fugir, ele cai."
#"He lays there in the dirt, sobbing, even though tears don't come out."
"Ele deita na areia do deserto, chorando, sem lágrimas."
#"He'd run out of those after all the things the man did to him."
"Ele não tinha mais nem uma depois de tudo que o homem fez com ele."

"A luz do sol é cegante. Ele se pergunta se isso seria Deus."
#"His mother is a devout Catholic, and even though he never believed, he promises this light that he'll become a believer right here and now if it saves him."
"A mãe dele é uma católica devota, e mesmo que ele nunca tivesse acreditado, ele promete que essa luz irá fazer ele acreditar ali mesmo se ela salvar ele."

#"His chest aches with overwhelming sadness and despair. And it's not just because he's about to die."
"O peito dele dói com desespero e tristeza imensos. E não é só por que ele vai morrer."
#"It's because his mom won't know what happened to him."
"É por que sua mãe não vai saber o que aconteceu com ele."
#"And it's because the last text message he saw from her said \"Love ya bug!!!\" with ten heart and kissing emojis."
"E é por que a última mensagem que ela mandou pra ele dizia \"Te amo filho\" com 10 emojis de coração e beijo."
#"At the time, he'd just rolled his eyes and didn't respond."
"Na hora, ele só virou o olho e não respondeu."
#"He thought he'd be able to do that the next day, or the day after that."
"Ele pensou que iria poder responder no próximo dia, ou alguns dias depois."
#"After he'd been kidnapped, the man took his phone and sat it on the counter."
"Depois que ele foi sequestrado, o homem colocou o celular dele no balcão."
#"It sat there and buzzed over and over with messages and his kidnapper only laughed when he asked to at least read them."
"Ele ficou ali, vibrando com várias mensagens enquanto o sequestrador ria quando ele pedia pra pelo menos ler elas."
#"Now the tears flow just as the man leans over him with something heavy in his paw."
"E agora as lágrimas vem assim que o homem se inclina em cima dele com algo pesado na pata."
#"He hopes his mom is right about God."
"Ele espera que sua mãe esteja certa sobre Deus."
#"He hopes he can see her from the other side."
"Ele espera poder ver ele no outro lado."
#"Just so he can respond somehow."
"Só pra ele poder dar algum tipo de resposta, qualquer resposta."

#"Cameron holds on to the seat tightly, the coyote's teeth rattling together with every pothole they hit."
"Cameron se segura no seu asento com força, os dentes do coiote rangendo juntos com todos os buracos na estrada."
#"His boyfriend, Devon, doesn't seem bothered at all; the bear's paw on the wheel with an elbow hanging out the window."
"Seu namorado, Devon, não parece se incomodar, uma pata do urso no volante e a outra pra fora da janela."
#"He had been singing loudly to the music playing through the car's Bluetooth speakers, and it wasn't until cell phone service was lost that Devon finally seemed to notice Cameron's unease."
"Ele estava cantando uma música tocando no alto falante do carro, e só quando seu celular perdeu serviço ele percebeu o desconforto de Cameron."
#d "\"You alright, babe?\""
d "\"Tá tudo bem, querido?\""
#c "\"I think you could go a little slower.\""
c "\"Pode ir mais devagar?\""
#d "\"What!?\""
d "\"Oi!?\""
#"Cameron raises his voice, yelling over the rattling interior."

c "\"Vai devagar!\""
#d "\"Why? This is the kind of terrain this baby was built for!\""
d "\"Por que? Essa belezura foi feita pra esse tipo de terreno!\""
#c "\"Okay, but--\""
c "\"Sim, mas-\""
#"Cameron's voice bounces as they hit another deep groove in the destroyed road."
"A voz do Cameron pula quando ele atinge outro buraco fundo na estrada destruída."
#c "\"We don't know what's around any of these bends. What if it just drops off and we go down a ravine, or something!?\""
c "\"A gente não sabe o que tem nas viradas. E se a gente descer numa ravina, ou alguma coisa?!\""
#d "\"That's what the roll bars are for, honey!\"
d "\"As barras de rolagem servem  pra isso, amor!\""

#d "\"Aw, come on. You gotta admit there's something nice about {i}feeling{/i} the road.\""
d "\"Ah, vai, admite, é muito legal poder {i}sentir{i} a estrada.\""
#"Cameron doesn't respond and goes on clutching at his seat."
"Cameron não responde e se segura no seu assento."
#"Devon does slow down a bit though, more carefully maneuvering around the most broken up parts of the road."
"Devon desacelera depois de um tempo, dirigindo com mais cuidado pelas partes mais despedaçadas da estrada."
#c "\"What happened to the road anyway? It's only been what, five years?\""
c "\"O que será que aconteceu com a estrada? fazem só o que, 5 anos?\""
#d "\"Flash floods, according to what I read online... Obviously no one's around for upkeep, so this is what happens.\""
d "\"Enchentes, pelo que eu li online... E não tem ninguém pra fazer manutenção, então acabou assim.\""
#c "\"Oh yeah, I forgot how this state works; dry as hell until a wall of watery death comes down the road during monsoon season.\""
c "\"Ah é, esqueci como funciona nesse Estado; seco pra cacete até uma parede de morte molhada descer do céu no inverno. \""
#"The coyote tenses up as the bear makes another smooth, but still sudden turn."
"O coiote se entijece no assento enquanto o urso faz outra curva suave, mas repentina."
#c "\"AND It's even hotter than I remember.\""
c "\"E é AINDA mais quente do que eu lembrava.\""
#d "\"How are you a coyote, Cameron? This is your climate!\""
d "\"Tem certeza que você é um coiote, Cameron? Esse é o seu habitat!\""
#c "\"You know better than to say that. Just because I'm built for it doesn't mean I have to like it.\""
c "\"Só porque eu sou feito pra essa temperatura não significa que eu tenho que gostar do calor.\""
#d "\"Yeah, yeah, but you hate it in Fort Allen, too.\""
d "\"Sim, sim, mas você odeia o calor de Fort Allen também.\""
#c "\"It doesn't get UNGODLY hot there though. I can at least deal with it.\""
c "\"Não fica calor DESSE jeito lá. Eu consigo aguentar, pelo menos.\""
#d "\"Well, the transfer to Bonneville City is looking good, so you won't have to deal with it much longer.\""
d "\"Bom, minha transferência pra Boneville tá parecendo boa, então você não vai precisar aguentar por mais muito tempo.\""
#"Cameron shrugs."
"Cameron dá de ombros."
#c "\"Milder weather would be nice, I guess.\""
c "\"Temperatura mais amena seria legal, acho.\""

"Devon sorri."
#d "\"Nicer weather, {w=0.3}nicer scenery, {w=0.3}and nicer people.\""

#c "\"Normal ones?{w=0.3} The ones that baptize dead people and wear Jesus jammies under their clothes?\""
c "\"Os normais?{w=0.3} Os que batizam gente morta e usam cueca de Jesus por baixo da roupa/\""
#"Dev shrugs."
"Dev dá de ombros"
#d "\"Most religions are weird when you break them down like that.\""
d "\"A maioria das religiões são estranhas se você parar pra pensar.\""
#c "\"I'm just saying, whether it's magic garments or prairie dresses, they came from the same fucked up place.\""
c "\"Eu só tô falando que, independepente de roupas mágicas ou vestidos curtos, elas vieram todaas do mesmo lugar fudido.\""
#"Devon doesn't say anything, and Cameron realizes how bitchy he sounds right now."
"Devon não diz nada, e Cameron percebe o quão mesquinho ele soa."
#c "\"Sorry, I just worry how they might look at us. It's harder to gauge people when they're all fake-nice.\""
c "\"Desculpa, eu só me preocupo em como eles podem olhar pra gente. É difícil saber o que pensam de nós se eles todos fingem ser bons.\"" 
#d "\"Yeah, that's true, but look--\""
d "\"Sim, eu entendo, mas olha--\""
#"Dev nods his head toward Cameron's window, and the coyote follows his gaze."
"Dev aponta um dedo pra janela do Cameron, e o coiote olha para a direção apontada."
#"The rocky, uneven landscape has opened up to a wide expanse of blue."
"A paisagem rochosa e desnivelada se abriu para um azul expansivo."
#d "\"That's Lake Emma, {w=0.3}which means Echo is--\""
d "\"Ali é o Lago Emma, {w=0.3}então Echo fica--\""
#"The bear looks ahead, and the first thing that Cameron sees is a tall, rusty sign with letters on the top that he can't quite read from this distance."
"O urso olha pra frente, e a primeira coisa que cameron vê é uma placa alta e emferrujada com letras que ele não consegue ler dessa distâsncia."
#"Below it is a small, shabby building, and beyond it are a few smaller, even shabbier buildings."
"Embaixo da placa, um prédio velho e mal cuidado, e além, prédios ainda mais velhos e mais acabados."
#"Cameron wasn't sure what he'd feel like when he first saw the town."
"Cameron não sabia o que ia sentir assim que visse a cidade."
#"If the coyote really is what Devon thinks he is, then right now he'd feel all the awful, evil things that supposedly happened here."
"Se o coiote realmente é o que Devon acha que ele é, então agora ele sentiria todas as coisas terríveis que supostamente aconteceram aqui."
#"Those small, run-down buildings should be exuding the memories of their past, which would then be projected into his mind."
"Esses prédios pequenos e acabados deveriam exalar memórias do passado, que seriam projetadas na sua mente."
#"But Cameron feels.{cps=3}.. {/cps}{w=0.3}nothing."
"Mas cameron.{cps=3}.. {/cps}{w=0.3}não sente nada."
#"Of course, he kind of knew this would be the case, but he'd never been to a place that was famously haunted."
"Claro, ele sabia que esses seria o caso, mas ele nunca esteve em um lugar famoso por ser assombrado."
#"Not like Echo, anyway."
"Não igual echo, pelo menos."
#"So he worried just a little bit."
"Então ele ficou um pouco preocupado."
#"Dev asked him in the past to go on his amateur \"paranormal investigations\"."
"Dev perguntou pra ele no passado se ele queria participar das suas \"investigações paranormais amadoras\"."
#"All because the coyote could \"see\" things."
"Tudo porque o coiote conseguia \"ver"\"coisas."
#"He'd remind Dev the proper word was \"hallucinate\"."
"Ele sempre falava para Dev que a palavra correta era \"alucinar\"."
#"The things he saw were manifested by his own mind."
"O que ele via eram coisas manifestadas pela sua própria cabeça."
#"There was no reason for him to give it fuel by going some place supposedly haunted."
"Não tinha razão pra ele desenterrar tudo isso indo em lugar supostamente abandonado."
#"Dev got the message pretty quickly and stopped asking."
"Dev entendeu o recado depois de um tempo e parou de perguntar."
#"They still talked about all those interests he had though, and Cameron realized there was a lot more to Devon's interest in ghosts than just dumb fun."
"Eles ainda conversavam sobre os interesses dele, e Cameron percebeu que tinha algo além da diversão no interesse de Devon por fantasmas."
#"And even though he'd refused to entertain Devon's psychic bullshit, the bear still took care of him."
"E mesmo que ele tenha recusado em particiopar das besteiras psíquicas do Devon, o urso ainda cuidava dele."
#"He'd done so much for the coyote that Cameron was embarrassed to think about it sometimes."
"Ele fez tanto pelo coiote que Cameron até ficava sem graça pensando sobre."
#"So, when Dev got this chance to go to the place he'd wanted to go the most, Cameron decided he had to go as well."
"Então, quando Dev teve a chance de ir pro lugar que ele mais queria ir, Cameron decidiu ir junto."
#"He's doing this for Dev, to show his appreciation for everything that Dev had done for him."
"Ele vai fazer isso por Devon, pra mostrar sua gratidão por tudo que Devon fez por ele."
#"Still, Devon had been trying to make this seem more like a vacation of sorts, like Cameron wouldn't be doing any investigations at all."
"Mesmo assim, Devon tentou fazer parecer que seria mais uma viagem, que Cameron não faria nenhuma investigação."
#"He would need to talk to the bear and let him know that he was willing to do this for real, at least within reason."
"Ele teria que conversar com o urso e deixar ele saber que ele estava disposto a ajudar de verdade, pelo menos dentro da razão."
#"He also needed to tell him why he didn't like doing this, and that part might be hard."
"ele também precisava falar pra ele o motivo de ele não querer fazer isso, e essa parte vai ser a mais difícil."
#c "\"It doesn't look so bad, for a ghost town, I mean.\""
c "\"Não parece tão ruim assim, pra uma cidade abandonada.\""
#d "\"Looks can be deceiving. Hang on. Gotta pull over for a sec.\""
d "\"As aparências enganam. Só um segundo, vou encostar o carro. \""
#c "\"Why?\""
c "\"Pra quê?\""
#d "\"Wanna scout out the lake a bit before dark, and I also gotta take a {i}massive{/i} leak.\""
d "\"Eu quero olhar o lago antes de escurecer, e eu também preciso {i}esvaziar a bexiga{/i}.\""
#"Cameron tries not to sigh, just wanting to get into the town so he can be sure that he doesn't feel anything."
"Cameron tenta não suspirar, só querendo ir direto pra cidade pra ter certeza que ele não sente nada."
#"To really make sure that there's nothing to be worried about."
"Pra ter certeza que não tem nada para se preocupar."
#"He isn't worried about ghosts, but rather his own brain and what it might do."
"Ele não se preocupa com fantasmas, mas sim com o que o seu cérebro e o que ele pode fazer"
#"The road becomes smoother and newer-looking as they pull up to the lake."
"A estrada fica mais lisa e menos envelhecida conforme eles chegam mais perto do lago."

#"Sure, they weren't in the town yet, but all those dreams he had, all those terrible feelings... They seem silly now."
"Ok, eles não estavam na cidade ainda, mas todos aqueles sonhos que ele teve, todos aqueles sentimentos ruins... Parecem bobos agora."

"Era só uma cidade antiga com um passado trágico."

"Cameron knows that his hallucinations aren't real. He's known that since he was a kid, after he first saw a monster in a raincoat in his trailer home."
"He also knows that ghosts aren't real, either."
"But Devon believes. Or at least he wants to believe."
"He wants it so badly, and he thinks Cameron can see them."
"Cameron knows there's something extremely wrong that what could be a disorder being used like this."
"Devon is also aware of this. {i}Painfully{/i} aware."
"To the point that Cameron was able to tell days in advance that he was going to ask about taking him on this trip."
"And yeah, this is wrong. But the bear doesn't even think Cameron is mentally ill, or at least that's how it comes off to the coyote."
"Devon doesn't understand how it feels to struggle with reality, to have these problems and never get a proper diagnosis."
"Cameron just knows that something is wrong, and always has been."
"That, and Cameron never really told him what it was like, so how could he understand?"
"He'd told him a little bit, but he'd always been worried in the back of his mind that Dev would leave if he told him everything."
"So Dev took those snippets of insight into Cameron's psyche and somehow interpreted it as him being \"gifted\"."
"He couldn't blame the bear; sometimes the things he sees do seem to have a deeper meaning, like there's more to it than just mental health."
"But isn't that just the nature of various mental disorders, not recognizing the illness for what it is?"
"It had been over five years at this point, and Dev had seen Cameron at his worst, at his absolute craziest, and somehow he'd stuck around and still believed the coyote was just a normal guy with some personal issues."
"Cameron hugs himself a little tighter, realizing that now is the time to really talk about it."
"And then after this they can have a fresh start in Bonneville."

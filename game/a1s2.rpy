"Cameron watches as the motel parking lot disappears into the night."
"They had left most of their stuff behind in the room, only bringing along what they absolutely needed."
"Cameron had wanted to take it a bit slower, to think things over before running away like this."
"But weirdly enough, it was Devon that was ushering him out as quickly as he could."
"Well, no, it made sense."
"What was truly weird was how Cameron had felt, and how he still feels now."
"Despite what had just happened, despite the absolute horror of it all, there's a part of Cameron that still wants to stay."
"Cameron has to assume that this is nothing like what Dev had seen in his previous investigations, that maybe he also felt that overwhelming feeling of wrongness."
"But.{cps=3}..{/cps}{w=0.4} it also feels wrong to just leave after hearing what he had heard."
"He'd expected Dev to want to stay after Cameron told him about Lupita."
"And if Dev had asked him to stay, Cameron would have done so, if only to search for better closure after hearing her scream."
"Despite Dev's calm appearance, Cameron knows that his mind must be in turmoil right now."
"Now, with the night ending like this, he thinks that maybe he shouldn't have told Devon what he heard."
"Yeah, he promised to be honest about it, but the hallucination, no--"
"--the vision--"
"--felt like a lie somehow, a trick."
"It felt real, it happened, but it also felt like something nefarious was behind it all."
"He felt it when the wolf focused on him, as if that unseen something had taken the wheel and started steering things where it wanted them to go."
"Even if he has no idea what that something could be, Cameron hopes that's the case."
"The alternative is that the afterlife really is only suffering, and that would mean his mother is in the same place."
"That everyone's going to that place."
"Cameron squirms in his seat, the feeling of a suffocating dread creeping up under his neck."

"Devon tilts his head slightly in Cameron's direction, brows raised to show he's listening."
d "\"Yeah, honey?\""
"He doesn't take his eyes off the road."
"Either because it's nighttime, or more likely because of what they just dealt with, the bear is being notably cautious."
"Still, there's a sense of urgency in his driving, like he's trying to get out of there as fast as he can."
"Cameron struggles to find the right words."
c "\"I-I, uh...\""
d "\"Hey, let's talk when I get on the freeway, okay? I just gotta focus right now.\""

"Fun."

c "\"Sorry, I--\""
d "\"No, you're fine. I'm just... having trouble seeing the goddamn road. Let's just leave it until I can see where I'm going, okay, hon?\""
"The coyote steels himself."
"He shouldn't ever feel afraid of Devon, he doesn't need to."
c "\"I think we should come back tomorrow, keep this going like you planned. There's something more to this and I want to help find out what it is.\""
"He says it firmly, in a way that he hopes shows Devon that he's not completely fragile, even if he did break down in the motel room."
"But Devon is quiet, and Cameron feels himself start to get a little frustrated that he's being ignored."
"But then the bear responds."
d "\"No.{cps=3}..{/cps}{w=0.4} No, {w=0.3}I don't think so.\""
d "\"I'll probably come back, but... with another psychic. I'm not gonna put you through that ever again.\""
"Despite knowing Devon means no offense by that, Cameron feels offended, like Devon doesn't think he's good enough, or strong enough to do this."
c "\"But I want to. Especially if you're just gonna come back. You think I'm just gonna sit at home, knowing you're back out in this hellhole?\""
d "\"Listen, Cameron. I've been to a lot of haunted places, but there's something different about this town that feels really off, 'fucked', like you said, and I don't want you anywhere near it.\""
d "\"You said to pull you back if things go south, and they went south.\""

"Then the bear is thrown into his seatbelt."

"He hadn't even remembered it was there until they'd folded down the seats for a place to try and sleep."
"He'd last played it at Devon's parents' house because they wanted to hear him perform, and he'd just left it there in the Jeep afterwards."
"He hadn't had a reason to play it since."
"The rest of the night, or early morning, really, hadn't been terrible."
"Dev was easily comfortable, the hard surface not all that different from his side of the mattress which was rock hard compared to Cameron's much squishier foam."
"He had tossed and turned until Dev finally pulled him in to lay his head on the bear's stomach, the soft warm surface enough to lull Cameron into a dozing state of consciousness while Dev snored loudly."
"He'd gotten used to the snoring after all these years, and now found it comforting rather than annoying."
"It was a good night, considering the circumstances."
"Dev had been unsure about sleeping in the tilted Jeep at all because it gave him a \"bad feeling\"."
"He also had a bad feeling about Cameron going back to the motel with him, so he'd left him here alone while the bear gathered up the rest of their stuff."
"Five hours had passed since Artie texted Devon, so the bear had been getting antsy about that as well."

c "\"I suck at guitar.\""
"He mumbles to himself quietly out of habit, knowing people didn't like hearing it since he was {i}good enough{/i}, which had been his goal."
"All of his singer-songwriter idols played guitar, and he'd wanted to be just like them."
"He'd forced himself to learn how to become good enough, with all the awkward fingerings, the constant tuning, and the pain of holding down steel strings with his finger pads, even after he built up callouses."
"That's how he'd describe guitar in general; a pain."
"He preferred piano, and that's what he used to write all of his music."
"But the devastatingly sad men of the '90s Northwest indie music scene didn't play piano, they played guitar, because they were also rugged and tough, molded by the logging towns they originated from."
"It turns out that one's image is just as important in indie as it is in pop, despite the former trying to convince itself it isn't."
"So Cameron had tried to conform to that, and in the end, it hadn't mattered."
"The hours and hours dedicated to learning the instrument through high school and college now felt wasted."
"Still, the feeling of the instrument is familiar in his paws, even if his fingers are already getting sore."
"He tries to think of one of his less embarrassing songs, one of the ones where he wasn't just wearing the influence of cloudy, dreary, Northwestern cities on his sleeve, even though that's where he's from."
"He'd tried and failed to duplicate their poetic and opaque lyricism."
"Instead, he found himself slipping back again and again to the style of his own generation."
"While his idols of the '90s wove lyrics that forced the listener to delve into something complex, to find meaning in the metaphors and symbolism--"
"--singer-songwriters born {i}in{/i} the '90s, like himself, presented their lyrics in a more literal, honest way that often described specific situations with seemingly nothing hidden."

"Dropped over text message with his agent saying the demos he'd made in-studio weren't \"up to their quality standard\"."
"That hurt, a lot, because he knew it was true; he'd been nervous the entire time, and his output wasn't even close to what he was capable of."

"I feel a jolt of worry and concern."
"Last Artie and I had talked, he mentioned that things were a bit strained between him and Maria, mainly because he was having a hard time trying to take care of her the way that he used to."
"If they're going to split up, I don't know what Arturo is going to do."

"While Artie and Cam were being hurt in ways that can never be fixed or undone."
"I feel my heart rate rise, and my breaths become heavier as adrenaline starts coursing through my body."

"If Cameron saw me doing this, on a mostly empty stomach, and after getting hit hard in the head, he would step in, no question."
"But he doesn't."
"After waiting for almost another hour, I head to bed, drunker than I've been since probably back in college."
"I curl into a ball, hugging Cameron's pillow tightly, silently begging him to come back."
"It's then that I start to process the idea that he could actually be gone."
"Cameron never said he could just leave, and he's never done it before."
"Maybe he doesn't even know how to come back."
"Silent begging isn't enough, and I mumble my coyote's name into the pillow over and over, hoping that, if he's here, he'll see how pathetic I look, and come back."
"But he doesn't."
"Maybe, somehow, this isn't real, because none of this feels real."
"Maybe this feeling of disbelief and devastation that's been with me since Echo has all been a dream, and I'll wake up in 2020, back with Cameron in bed next to me."
"I'm lucky I'm so drunk, because I don't know how I'd deal with this sober."
"For now, I just cry myself to sleep."

"I'm standing in the doorway of one of the music classrooms."
"The one that Cameron likes to go to in the early evenings so that he can play on the grand piano."
"It's interesting, being in his world."
"I haven't spent much time outside the engineering building since finishing my general studies, but being here, looking around at all the instruments..."
"I appreciate it all a bit more compared to the last time I was in this building, when I took intro to music theory a few years ago."
"These are the good times, but I won't know it, not until Echo."
c "\"See? Piano is way easier for me.\""
d "\"I thought you sounded just fine on guitar.\""
"It was his voice that I really liked, though: Rough and smoky, but delivered with a smoothness that reminds me of old, black-and-white movies."
"Two weeks in, and I'm already cautiously hoping this relationship will turn into something more."
"Cautious because Jesús is still fresh in my mind."
"The relationship had only lasted for a few months, but I wasn't ready for the rejection that I didn't even see coming."
"It worries me a little that this canine might do the same thing."
"For now though, he's smiling as he continues to play."
"I can see the red tinging the skin inside his ears, making me think he's probably feeling the same way I did when I was showing him the advanced math and physics classes I'm taking."
"But I am impressed."
"The coyote's innate ability to seemingly pull beautiful and catchy melodies together seems just as impossible as Cameron said my course work looked."
d "\"Where do you even start?\""
c "\"Hm?\""
"Cameron looks up from playing."
d "\"Like, just the music in general: How do you just come up with it on the fly like that?\""
c "\"Oh, well...\""

c "\"Everyone's different, obviously, but I guess once you really learn how music works, and combine that with the music you listen to, you can just sort of--\""
"Again, his fingers play effortlessly across the keys."
"Something tells me my limited music library wouldn't give me the experience I would need to be able to do this."
"Cameron had already teased me a little about listening to \"dad-rock\"."
"He quickly showed me that he also listened to some dad-rock too, but he listens to everything, from rock, to pop, to jazz, to classical, he enjoys it all."
"It had left me feeling flushed and embarrassed, even though there wasn't a good reason to feel that way."
"Now that I think about it, I realize that I've embarrassed myself in front of Cameron quite a few times now, and I'm not sure if that's a good sign or not."
"Like maybe I'm just paying more attention to what I say and do in front of him."
"Artie walking in on us fucking was mortifying, no matter how I look at it, but Cameron had laughed about it afterwards, and he even talks to Artie."
"They get along really well."
"That's when Cameron suddenly stops playing, looking at the clock above the classroom door."
c "\"Well, they said my song could come on at any time after five, but you know, they might not even end up playing it.\""
"And there's the pessimism I've come to expect."
"It's not bitter, or upset; he's just lowering his expectations to avoid disappointment, which is kind of the opposite of how I think of things."
d "\"They will.\""
"Cameron shrugs, looking unbothered."
"I'm not exactly sure what it is about him that's making this all... feel so important."
"He's cute, funny, smart, and we have longer, deeper conversations than I've had with anyone else."
"His songs sounded a little angsty, but through their dark humor, there's a lot of sadness and pain in the lyrics."
"When I asked him about it, he brushed it off, saying he was exaggerating in the songs."
"Everyone exaggerates."
"He's scared to tell me about his past, and that makes me a little scared too, but maybe with some time, once I figure him out more..."
"But something is telling me that this is going to turn into something much more, like this is more than just a college fling, more than just a boyfriend."
"It's almost like I can see the future."
c "\"Well, we can, you know.\""
d "\"Huh?\""
"Cameron starts playing again, this time with a different, but no less gentle and pretty melody."
c "\"See the future. Besides, this has already happened.\""
d "\"Um...\""
c "\"It's me, Devon.\""
"There's a slight laugh in his voice, one that sounds more surprised than anything"
"I let my mind fall back into that current, confused, traumatized, and angry mindset I seem to always be in now."
d "\"But you left. I felt it.\""
c "\"I... I actually don't know what happened, but I didn't like it.\""
c "\"Everything was dark and quiet, but then you were dreaming, and now I'm here.\""
d "\"You're back with me?\""
c "\"I think so, yeah.\""
"I sit on the bench next to Cameron, reaching out to touch him."
"He's solid, and through his sweatshirt, I can feel his slender frame."
"He's real."
"We hug."
"We kiss."
"It's just like it used to be."
"How does this feel so real?"
d "\"Is this really a dream?\""
c "\"A half-dream, I think. This has happened a few times before, like I've visited you when you were dreaming, remember?\""
d "\"Like what happened in Echo?\""
c "\"That was more like a nightmare. This is a good dream.\""
"Cameron continues playing on the piano."
c "\"I don't know. You have this beacon-like quality about you that no one else does. I... I think I'll always be able to find my way back.\""
"I kiss him again."
d "\"Can we not go back? I want to stay here forever.\""
"Cameron laughs."
c "\"We've got time, as long as we don't try to wake up too hard. We might even end up right back here again, if things line up right.\""
d "\"But what if we don't?\""
c "\"Then we'll stay here as long as we can and not worry about it.\""
"I'm reminded of other qualities about the coyote that I love, the way he's often so stressed and full of anxiety, but then suddenly surprises me with his durability, and his bravery."
"Especially when it comes to helping others."
"I just wish he'd remember that more when it comes to himself."
"I relax a bit as the warm, late afternoon light continues to pour into the room, lighting up the shiny instruments and the dust motes that swirl around us."
"I can see that the campus grounds are empty and not bustling with the usual combination of after-class hangouts and studying."

"Instead of even listening to the song, we just made out."
"Man, we sure were horny back then."
c "\"Back... then?\""
"But Cameron doesn't say it."
"Or his mouth doesn't move, at least, and his voice is different, maybe a little deeper."
"Mainly, though, it comes from behind me."
"The Cameron I'm looking at reacts at the same time, spinning to look back, and I do the same."

"In the split second that I see it, I know what I'm looking at."
"Cameron had told me about it, how it's been following us around since Echo, how it's sort of an Echo itself, one that manifested after Brian murdered him."
"We don't know what it wants, but it hurts my Cameron, reminds him of the pain he went through, and as I look at this fake Cameron, I feel that old anger."
"The same strange, cold, fury that had blossomed in my chest after seeing what Brian had done, how it overrode the shock and incoming grief just long enough for me to finish the old bear."
"I feel my teeth draw back in a feral snarl, warning this echo back, and it reacts by looking at me with fear and sadness."
"For some reason, that only makes me angrier, and I take in everything that makes this coyote so different from the one I know so well."
"There's a glazed look in its eyes, like it just woke up, and its build is all wrong, thicker and pudgier than Cameron had ever been."
"No, this is some warped, sick creation."
"It's not even alive, but I know it can still hurt us."
"It's too late though, as I hear a strange, gurgling hiss next to me."
"I look."

"When Brian shot Cameron in the face, half of it had been blown away, splattering the walls of the cave and filling it with a smell that I will never forget."
"Even now, it fills my nostrils, and I just sit there, shaking and staring at Cameron, seeing his wide, twitching eye, like he's alive, like he's alive and feeling it."
"But now, I get to see him in agonizing detail without the blood and gore covering the rest of him up."
"Now I wonder if he was somehow alive and feeling the pain in the seconds after the shotgun blast, when I couldn't see any part of his face clearly."
d "\"STOP!\""
"I yell at the echo, at the dream, at anything to make it stop."
"I reach out my right paw for Cameron's trembling shoulder, scared to touch him because I'm worried I'll make the pain worse."
"Even now, in this dream world, I can see the scars just visible through the fur on my right forearm, where Cameron's jaw and teeth had been embedded."
"They'd had to be surgically removed, and all I can really remember is asking a nurse if I could keep his teeth once they'd been taken out."
"I didn't know what I'd have left of Cameron then, even though he was already talking to me, trying to keep me calm."

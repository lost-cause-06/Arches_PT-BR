"Cameron stays curled up on the floor for what feels like a long time."
"He had ultimately decided that he'd rather watch the harmless, pulsating arches dance behind his eyelids, rather than the nightmare the trailer is becoming."
"Every minute or so, the reality of the situation hits the coyote, and a burst of whimpering gasps escape his muzzle for a few minutes before fading back to only whimpering."
"He would stay down there until his trip was over, but Brian ended up pulling him back to where he was sitting."
"At this point, the coyote doesn't fight the bear, going limp while his body is pulled along."
"For a minute, Brian tries to get him to sit in the chair, but eventually just gives up, dropping Cameron next to the table where he just lies on the floor."
"The coyote listens to the old bear moving around the trailer, though it's barely audible over his own gasping sobs."
"Eventually, those lumbering, shuffling footsteps come closer, and Cameron knows that the old bear is crouching next to him, though the coyote still doesn't open his eyes."
b "\"Listen, kid. Since you ain't gonna calm down, you're taking some xans, got it?\""
"Cameron listens, but doesn't move, afraid to do anything."
"Then he flinches as a rough, calloused paw grabs up his chin, forcing his mouth open slightly."

"In a flash of rage and desperation, Devon viciously gnaws at his right forearm, snarling."
"Again, he knows it's senseless, pointless, detrimental, but the self-loathing is all-consuming, and mostly he just wants to punish himself."
"After several seconds he stops, and after blinking away the blur of tears, he sees that while some fur is missing, he barely broke the skin."
"Devon lets out a hopeless, despairing laugh, even while tears stream down his face."
"The metal enclosure makes the laugh sound loud and hollow, and that's when Devon stops as he realizes how unhinged he sounds, how he shouldn't be acting like this."
"He doesn't have a right to break down."
"His friend is dead, and his best friend..."
"Devon knows he needs to do everything he can to get out."
"The next time Brian is within reach, he's going to do everything he can to make sure he dies."
"He'll rip his throat out."
"But while that fire is rekindled in his chest, he can't fight whatever drug the bear gave him."
"Devon suspects that it's making him a bit delirious, too."
